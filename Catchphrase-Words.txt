one leg in the door
why the long face?
in the same boat
up a creek without a paddle
raining cats and dogs
feeling under the weather
green with envy
frog in your throat
head over heels in love
a wolf in sheep's clothing
grab the bull by the horns
out of this world
water under the bridge
put your foot in your
mouth
bull in a china closet
tie the knot
have two left feet
get cold feet
bouncing off the walls
third wheeling
when in Rome
one smart cookie
caught red-handed
the squeaky wheel gets the grease
a fly on the wall
jump the gun
throw a fit
take a hike
carry a tune
eat my words
apple of my eye
hit the road
a blessing in disguise
piece of cake
all bark and no bite
when pigs fly
cost an arm and a leg
hold your horses
the whole nine yards
back to the drawing board
go out on a limb
wake up on the wrong side of the bed
steal my thunder
once in a blue moon
let the cat out of the bag
grab the bull by the horns
dancing a ballet
washing an elephant
rock climbing
shopping at the mall
playing soccer
flying a kite
going bowling
scuba diving
chasing a tornado
building a campfire
sewing a dress
playing four square
filming a movie
riding a carousel
playing chess
finger painting
visiting the zoo
sewing on a button
ironing a shirt
baking bread
making a pizza
having a food fight
paddling in a canoe
delivering mail
riding a motorcycle
flipping pancakes
sorting laundry
playing hopscotch
hailing a taxi
landing an airplane
watering a garden
mowing a lawn
raking leaves
feeding the ducks
building a sandcastle
playing baseball
milking a cow
setting up a tent
whale watching
trick-or-treating
walking with crutches
riding in a chairlift
sumo wrestling
digging a hole
riding bumper cars
practicing karate
hang-gliding
cutting someone's hair
swimming with dolphins
playing with play dough
going through airport security
filling up a car with gas
ordering food
watching a movie 
climbing Mount Everest
playing at a piano recital
asking for an autograph
walking through a haunted house
opening birthday presents
body surfing at the beach
painting the walls in a room
being a flight attendant
washing windows on a building
